# High school compositions

> A chapter of featherless' [digital creative history](https://github.com/featherless/digital-creative-history).

My friends and I spent a good amount of time in high school playing around with FruityLoops. I
wasn't particularly great at it, but a couple tracks turned out better than the others.

## Running

This track is just a random assortment of loops being taken in and out. Felt to me like running in
an exaggerated cartoon.

## Village

My first "melody". The idea popped into my head on the way home from school and I managed to capture
it once I got home.

## Delicate feelings

Simply descending. Created this with a video game scene in mind.
